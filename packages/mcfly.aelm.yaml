    "McFly - fly through your shell history. McFly replaces your default ctrl-r
    shell history search with an intelligent search engine that takes into
    account your working directory and the context of recently executed
    commands. McFly's suggestions are prioritized in real time with a small
    neural network. TL;DR: an upgraded ctrl-r where history results make sense
    for what you're working on right now."
