mprocs:
  description: |
    "mprocs runs multiple commands in parallel and shows output of each command
    separately.
    
    When you work on a project you very often need the same list of commands to be
    running. For example: webpack serve, jest --watch, node src/server.js. With
    mprocs you can list these command in mprocs.yaml and run all of them by
    running mprocs. Then you can switch between outputs of running commands and
    interact with them."
