    "A syntax-highlighting pager for git, diff, and grep output. Code evolves,
    and we all spend time studying diffs. Delta aims to make this both efficient
    and enjoyable: it allows you to make extensive changes to the layout and
    styling of diffs, as well as allowing you to stay arbitrarily close to the
    default git/diff output."
