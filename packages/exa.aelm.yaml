exa:
  description: |
    "exa is a modern replacement for the venerable file-listing command-line
    program ls that ships with Unix and Linux operating systems, giving it more
    features and better defaults. It uses colours to distinguish file types and
    metadata. It knows about symlinks, extended attributes, and Git. And it’s
    small, fast, and just one single binary.
    
    By deliberately making some decisions differently, exa attempts to be a more
    featureful, more user-friendly version of ls. For more information, see exa’s
    website."
