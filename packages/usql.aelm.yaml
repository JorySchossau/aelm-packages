usql:
  description: |
    "usql is a universal command-line interface for PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle
    Database, SQLite3, Microsoft SQL Server, and many other databases including
    NoSQL and non-relational databases!
    
    usql provides a simple way to work with SQL and NoSQL databases via a
    command-line inspired by PostgreSQL's psql. usql supports most of the core psql
    features, such as variables, backticks, and commands and has additional
    features that psql does not, such as syntax highlighting, context-based
    completion, and multiple database support."
