    "ripgrep is a line-oriented search tool that recursively searches the
    current directory for a regex pattern. By default, ripgrep will respect
    gitignore rules and automatically skip hidden files/directories and binary
    files. ripgrep has first class support on Windows, macOS and Linux, with
    binary downloads available for every release. ripgrep is similar to other
    popular search tools like The Silver Searcher, ack and grep."
