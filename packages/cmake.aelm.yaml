   description: |
     "CMake is an open-source, cross-platform family of tools designed to build,
     test and package software. CMake is used to control the software
     compilation process using simple platform and compiler independent
     configuration files, and generate native makefiles and workspaces that can
     be used in the compiler environment of your choice. The suite of CMake
     tools were created by Kitware in response to the need for a powerful,
     cross-platform build environment for open-source projects such as ITK and
     VTK."
