    "Paperboy is a tiny .pdf management utility.
    
    If you download papers and other pdf documents, you might have noticed that
    filenames like 1412.4880.pdf are not terribly helpful for finding anything
    later on. Especially if your download folder also contains about eighty files
    along the lines of catloaf.jpg, David_Lynch_Teaches_Typing.zip, and
    160502_0001.wav.
    
    This tool helps with that. It will offer to rename and move files to a
    specified folder, and it even gives some filename suggestions by looking at the
    content and the pdf metadata.
    
    Paperboy keeps its file management dumb on purpose (no keeping files in a
    database or hidden library folder), so you can uninstall it at any time and
    your files will remain perfectly accessible."
