    "Zellij is a workspace aimed at developers, ops-oriented people and anyone
    who loves the terminal. At its core, it is a terminal multiplexer (similar
    to tmux and screen), but this is merely its infrastructure layer.
    Zellij includes a layout system, and a plugin system allowing one to create
    plugins in any language that compiles to WebAssembly.
    For more details about our future plans, read about upcoming features in our
    roadmap.
    Zellij was initially called 'Mosaic'."
